/*
! What is jQuery?
* jQuery is a JS library that is widely used but slowly becoming antiquated.
It takes a lot of the lengthy aspects of JavaScript and simplifies it quite a bit.

document.querySelector("h1") becomes jQuery("h1")...or $("h1")

*jQuery can be incorporated by using CDN, and Google's is the most popular.
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

* The positioning of this script is important-- make sure it's above your own personal scripts at the end of the page.
