/*
! Using the REPL:
* (Read Eval Print Loop)
- A computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated and then the results are returned to the user (similar to writing JS directly in the browser dev tools)

* The 'node' command enters you into the REPL from the command line.

The native modules Node.js comes with can be thought of as a toolbox we already have at home to let us create our web apps.

NPM is like shopping for specific tools that others have made and are sharing with other developers.
