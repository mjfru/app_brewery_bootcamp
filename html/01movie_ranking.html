    <h1>The Best Movies According to Matt</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
    <p>The classic fantasy epic that is, indeed, as good as the books.</p>
    <h3>Shutter Island</h3>
    <p>One of the few horror movies to make my top twenty, suspenseful and master acting with an ending I'm still pondering.</p>
    <h3>Kung-Pow! Enter the Fist</h3>
    <p>Outrageous. Infinitely quotable. A true one-of-a-kind and one-hit wonder comedy.</p>
